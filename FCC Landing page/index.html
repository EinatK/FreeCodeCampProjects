                Rayman, more commonly known as Rayman 1, is the first game in the Rayman series and features the debut
                of the titular character. The game was first released in 1995 on the Sony PlayStation, Atari Jaguar,
                Sega Saturn, and PC/MS-DOS. The game was later ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2001, under the name
                Rayman Advance, Nintendo DSi in 2009 and iOS and Android in 2016, under the name Rayman Classic. The
                PlayStation version was released in 2008 on the PlayStation Network as a downloadable PSOne Classic,
                playable on PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. The Nintendo DSi version was
                released alongside other DSiWare titles on the Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.
                On December 3rd, 2018, the PlayStation version will be re-released with the PlayStation Classic.
            </p>
            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
                The entire game takes place in the valley, a diverse and surreal location somewhere in the Glade of
                Dreams. Prior to the beginning of the game, all is harmonious; a mystical pink orb known as the Great
                Protoon provides peace and balance to the world. However, this cannot last – one day, the evil Mr Dark
                steals the Great Protoon and defeats its guardian, Betilla the Fairy. The natural balance of the world
                is disrupted; freaks and hostile characters begin to appear. The Electoons, small friendly creatures
                which gravitated around the Great Protoon, are scattered across the valley and imprisoned in cages by
                Mr Dark's minions. A benevolent character known as the Magician turns to the heroic Rayman for help.
                The Magician gives Rayman these tasks: free the Electoons from their cages, and recover the Great
                Protoon from Mr Dark. Only then will the balance of the world be restored. The valley contains six
                distinct worlds, and Rayman must pass through each of them in order to fulfill his objectives and reach
                his ultimate goal.
            </p>
            <h2>Powers and Power-Ups</h2>
            <p>At the start of the game, Rayman is only able to pull a grimace, which is used to scare certain enemies.
                As he continues, he will receive permanent powers from Betilla the Fairy that gradually widen his
                abilities, as well as receive a few temporary ones.
            </p>
            <h3>Permanent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grimace:</strong> Rayman's only ability at the game's beginning, only useful for getting
                    rid of tall Livingstones which are scared of this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Telescopic fist:</strong> The first power that Rayman gains from Betilla the Fairy, which
                    allows Rayman to punch enemies to defeat them. This can be temporarily powered up by Speed Fists
                    and Golden Fists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hanging:</strong> Allows Rayman to hang onto ledges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grappling fist:</strong> When acquired, Rayman can use his fist to grapple onto flying
                    rings which are scattered around the place, allowing him to reach high places and cross wide gaps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Helicopter:</strong> When acquired, Rayman can use his odd looking hair as a helicopter
                    which only allows him to glide, and prolong his jumps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Running:</strong> Rayman's last permanent power, which allows him to move faster than
                    walking. It also makes his jumps a lot longer and faster. This replaces the grimace.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Temporary </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Magic seed: </strong> Given to Rayman after helping Tarayzan, Rayman plants seeds to help
                    him reach ledges and escape floods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Super helicopter: </strong> A potion that allows Rayman to actually fly with his helicopter
                    hair.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shrinking: </strong> Touching Blue elves makes Rayman tiny, which is useful for accessing
                    areas which were too small for normal-sized Rayman to go through. He returns to normal size when he
                    touches another Flying blue elf.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Power-Ups </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tings: </strong> Small blue bubbles, used either to pay the Magician to enter a bonus
                    stage, or
                    to gain an extra life when 100 are collected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Powers: </strong> Comes in either a small red atom with a P on the front, or a large red
                    one -
                    the former gives Rayman one or two units of health, while the latter replenishes his entire health.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Speed Fist: </strong> Allows Rayman's fist to fly faster than normal. Three different
                    speeds
                    are available.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Golden Fist: </strong> Allows Rayman's fist to be twice as strong.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Life: </strong> Gives Rayman an extra life, as well as restoring his entire health.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Throughout the game, Rayman meets an array of different characters, some of which aid him through his
                journey.
            </p>
            <h3>Friends</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Magician: </strong>He introduces the game's story. He can also be found at several
                    points of the game, in which he would offer Rayman to access bonus stages and help him win extra
                    lives, for a price of ten Tings.</li>
                <li><strong>Betilla the Fairy: </strong>A benevolent floating female fairy who failed to protect the
                    Great Protoon from Mr Dark. She holds a very important role in the game – she gives Rayman new
                    powers during the adventure.</li>
                <li><strong>Tarayzan: </strong>Rayman's jungle counterpart, he gives Rayman a magic seed in return for
                    giving him back his loincloth. One of the very few others to be seen from Rayman's species.</li>
                <li><strong>The Photographer: </strong>This character acts as checkpoint. Should Rayman lose a life, he
                    will return to where he last had his photograph taken.</li>
                <li><strong>The Musician: </strong>Located high in the Blue Mountains with his family, his guitar had
                    been crushed by a rock which Rayman must break to make him a new one out of stone. In return, the
                    Musician gives Rayman the Super helicopter power.</li>
                <li><strong>Joe the Extra-Terrestrial: </strong>An alien that owns his own snack bar on the beach in
                    the Caves of Skops. His neon lights have been unplugged, and Rayman must go down into the dark
                    caves to plug them back in.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Enemies</h3>

                        Mr Stone:

                <li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Bad Rayman: </strong> The result of a spell that Mr Dark casts in the Candy Château who
                    resembles Rayman with a dark palette and mimics every move he makes throughout the stage. He can
                    only be defeated by finishing a stage while letting him follow Rayman.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mr Dark: </strong> The main antagonist of the game, who steals Rayman's fist powers and
                    casts strange spells on him. When he finally approaches him he would not really fight but rather
                    trap Rayman with walls of fire. At this point the Electoons return the fist, but Mr Dark flees
                    after, leaving him to actually fight hybrids of the previous bosses. His hideout is located in the
                    Candy Château.
